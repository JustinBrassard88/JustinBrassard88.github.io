    <h1>About My Website</h1>
    <p> Welcome to my first website for GEOM101. In this class, we are learning to use HTML and CSS to formula a website. 
        This website will give you a look at what I was able to implement for this assignment. I will be providing background 
        information about myself along with some of my hockey background experience.</p>
    <p> My name is Justin Brassard. I was born in Bolton Ontario, which is a small town located located northwest of Missisauga, 
        Ontario. I have lived here with my whole life as my parents moved here from northern Ontario before I was born.</p>
