    <div class="Regular_Text"> 
    <p> My name is Justin Brassard. I was born in Bolton Ontario, which is a small town located located northwest of Missisauga, 
        Ontario. I have lived here with my whole life as my parents moved here from northern Ontario (Kapuskasing) before I was born.
        I am currently 21 years old and I was born on September 10th 2000. My hobbies include playing sports, spending time with 
        friends and family (Mom, Dad and Brother), and of course, GIS. Some things that people often say about me are that I am a very organized individual, 
        respectful, an honest person, and my values for my intergrity within my work are very high. I am consistently looking 
        to learn new skills and expand my knowldege in any way that I can. In my mind, this will benefit me now and in the future.</p>

    <h2>Why am I attending Fleming college?</h2>
        </div>   

<!-- This is my third paragraph which provides some background as to why I am pursuing GIS and why I am attending Fleming College.
     Ideology from: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp --> 
        <div class="Regular_Text"> 
    <p> I graduated Humberview Secondary school (Highschool) in 2018 and originally went to McMaster University for the business commerce 
        program. I quickly realized that this program wasn't for me after taking and enjoying an elective in geography at the school. I proceeded
        the following year by switching into the Geography and Environmental sciences program. I proceeded to do well while also being able to take 
        many courses in GIS which sparked my interest in it. I graduated from McMaster last year with a 3 year bachelor's degree in geography and a 
        certificate in GIS. As my dad also studied GIS in school, he was another reason I was inspired to get into this field as he showed me so much 
        about it. He currently does not work in GIS, but rather in ILI pipeline analysis for a company based in Indianapolis, USA. He was able to 
        help guide me and explained to me that the program at fleming is highly renown for GIS and that it would be a great benefit for me to apply to 
        get in when I graduate University. I took this into great consideration and decided to take his advice as GIS is what I want to pursue in the future.
        I am hoping by taking this program that I can expand my knowledge and learn many things applicable in the GIS world that can benefit me in the future 
        (Which I already have). I am currently enjoying the program and am learning lots of things in programming through python, HTML and CSS that I didn't 
        even know about in GIS. I hope this great experience continues and I can't wait to continue my learning in the program.</p>
