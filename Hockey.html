    <h2>My Hockey Life:</h2>

<!-- This is my first paragraph which provides information on my hockey experiences -->
    <p> Hockey has been something that has been greatly influential in my life throughout my childhood. I started taking skating 
        lessons originally when I was 6 years old because my dad is a big hockey fanatic. He played a high level of hockey when he 
        was younger and always wanted one of his kids to take up the sport. Since I was the first born between me and my brother, I 
        was the one he first introduced to the sport. I started actually playing the sport when I was around 8 years old and I am 
        still playing to this day. I always played for my hometown throughout my journey in the hockey world. I started off playing 
        houseleague for one year annd shortly after made my way up into the rep system. Going through the rep levels from AE to A to AA,
        I continuoously made progress and grew my skills to become better at the game. Unfortunately I never reached my goal of becoming an
        NHL player, but this is every kids dream. Do you blame me? Today I continue to play hokcey in a men's league for fun on the weekends 
        with my friends. I hope to continue my hockey journey until I can't no more (Most likely due to age of course),and I hope to carry on this
        'Family Tradition' that my dad included me and my brother in. </p>

    <h2>What did I learn from hockey?</h2>

<!-- This is my first paragraph which provides information on my hockey experiences -->
    <p> As this sport continues to be an important aspect of my life, it still inspires me to this day as you learn so many life values and skills outside of 
        just playing the game. Going to various tournaments and sport events during the time I was playing the game allowed me and an individual to develop 
        life skills. I learned core values including respect and time management along with various others. These values have changed me as a person, and 
        allowed me to become the person that I am today. I will forever be greatful for that. Hockey to me was much more then just a game. It was a learning curve,
        a good place to meet friends and an opportunity to travel to various places. But generally, the game allowed me to grow as a person 
        through our team values. Overall, the game has changed my life forever and I continue to carry on the values I learned through rep hockey.  </p>
